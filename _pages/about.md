## Career
I am currently working at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a Deep
Learning Engineer. Here I develop and engineer deep learning frameworks (esp.
TensorFlow) for improving the performance and efficiency on GPUs. I received my
Ph.D. at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.vt.edu/)
of [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). My research topic is the performance
portability of various computational kernels on modern accelerators, such as
CPUs, MICs and GPUs.


## Selected Publications

Here lists some of my publications regarding high performance computing:

* [Doctoral Dissertation] **Kaixi Hou**. "*Exploring Performance Portability for Accelerators via High-level Parallel Patterns*". Virginia Tech, VTechWorks. May, 2018. [PDF](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/84923), [Slides](/assets/slides/Final_Exam_Kaixi_Hou_no_anime.pdf)
* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
