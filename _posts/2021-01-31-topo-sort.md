## Introduction
Recently I was working on a project related to the operation fusion in
Tensorflow. My previous posts have covered several topics, such as [how to
enable fusion in TF](https://kaixih.github.io/fused-api/), [what's inside the
CBR fusion](https://kaixih.github.io/cbr-fusion/). I found I encountered the
topological sort (topo_sort) often but I realized that probably I didn't fully
understand it. Originally, my understanding of topo_sort came from some coding
interview books, and I knew it was simply a DFS variant, but this didn't answer
my questions that always in the back of my mind. By checking the implementation
of the topo_sort in TF, I think I found the answers. In this post, I am going to
list my questions and by analyzing each of them, it might be able to shed some
light on how a more robust topo_sort should be implemented.

## Q1: Is Topological Sort a DFS preorder traversal?
To be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the type of DFS traversal when I
learned the topo_sort. For example, in the left graph of Figure 1, it seems a DFS
pre-order traversal is sufficient to produce the correct topological order of 0,
1, 2, 3. However, the method is brittle and easy to lead to wrong results if we
simply change the order of the nodes as in the middle graph of Figure 1. In this
case, we would probably get 0, 1, 2, 3 if the nodes are still swept in numerical
order. But maybe we can argue that the correct order 3, 0, 1, 2 can still be
achieved if we always start from the root node (which has no fanin edges).
Unfortunately, this is not true. For instance, in the right graph in Figure 1, the
preorder traversal will always fail to work, no matter which node we start from.

In fact, the DFS used in topo_sort is a reversed, postorder traversal. The
postorder traversal can make sure that all the child nodes get processed  before
the current node. More importantly, it doesn't matter if we start from the root
node or not. For example, in the middle graph of Figure 1, the postorder
traversal will always generate the order of 2, 1, 0, 3 regardless of the start
node. After the traversal, we need one more step to reverse the order to get the
correct result. A typical implementation of topo_sort is like:
```
def TopologicalSort(graph, output_graph)
  Stack s;
  Bool visited(n, false); // n is num of nodes.
  For (each node i in graph)
    If (not visited[i])
      Helper(i, /*other params*/)
  s.pop(all nodes) to output_graph // reverse

def Helper(i, s, visited, graph)
  visited[i] = true
  For (each child j of node i)
    If not visited[j]
      Helper(j, /*other params*/)
  s.push(node i) // post_order traversal
```

## Q2: How can we group the nodes belonging to the same graph together?
Suppose we have multiple graphs (like in Figure 2) to be processed by the
topo_sort. The above topo_sort implementation could probably produce 2, 3, 1, 5,
0, 4. We can see that it is still a valid topological order; however, the nodes
from the two graphs are interleaved in the results, which might be not desirable
in many cases. One solution is to limit the start nodes to root nodes instead of
any nodes during the sweep. With this simple change, we could obtain the order
of 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5.

## Q3: How to deal with cycles? Or what happens when there are cycle graphs?
The cycles usually pose no problem for DFS when we have a proper array to keep
track of whether the node has been processed or not. However, if we have a cycle
graph, the "start-from-the-root-node" strategy will leave all the nodes in the cycle
graph unprocessed. For example, Figure 3 has a cycle graph, meaning it has no
root node to allow the sweep to begin with, and thus the result will be like 6,
1, 0, 4. To solve the issue, we can conduct a second round of sweep that starts
from any unprocessed nodes. That way, the final order will contain all nodes: 2,
5, 3, 6, 0, 1, 4.

## An implementation example
[The topo_sort used in
TF](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/grappler/utils/graph_view.cc)
can handle the above issues. Inspired by it, I gave a shot at implementing a
toy topo_sort, which is non-recursive and features the ability to detect cycles.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

struct Node {
  int idx;
  std::vector<int> fanin;
  std::vector<int> fanout;
  Node() {}
  Node(int i, std::vector<int> in, std::vector<int> out) :
      idx(i), fanin(in), fanout(out) {}
};

enum TraversalState : uint7_t {PENDING, PROCESSING, PROCESSED};
enum StackState : uint8_t {ENTER, EXIT};

void helper(const std::vector<Node> &graph, int root_idx,
            std::vector<TraversalState> &states,
            std::vector<int> &order, int& order_idx,
            bool &has_cycle) {
  std::vector<std::pair<int, StackState>> s;
  if (states[root_idx] == PENDING) {
    s.push_back({root_idx, ENTER});
  }
  while(!s.empty()) {
    auto cur_entry = s.back();
    s.pop_back();
    if (states[cur_entry.first] == PROCESSED) {
      continue;
    } else if (cur_entry.second == EXIT) {
      states[cur_entry.first] = PROCESSED;
      order[cur_entry.first] = order_idx--;
    } else {
      states[cur_entry.first] = PROCESSING;
      s.push_back({cur_entry.first, EXIT});
      auto &cur_node = graph[cur_entry.first];
      for (int j = 0; j < cur_node.fanout.size(); j++) {
        if (states[cur_node.fanout[j]] == PENDING) {
          s.push_back({cur_node.fanout[j], ENTER});
        } else if (states[cur_node.fanout[j]] == PROCESSING) {
          has_cycle = true;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

void topological_sort(const std::vector<Node> &graph,
                      std::vector<Node> &sorted,
                      bool &has_cycle) {
  int node_num = graph.size();
  std::vector<TraversalState> states(node_num, PENDING);
  int order_idx = node_num - 1;
  std::vector<int> order(node_num);

  for(int i = 0; i < node_num; i++) {
    if (graph[i].fanin.size() == 0) {
      helper(graph, i, states, order, order_idx, has_cycle);
    }
  }

  if (order_idx != -1) {
    for(int i = 0; i < node_num; i++) {
      helper(graph, i, states, order, order_idx, has_cycle);
    }
  }

  for(int i = 0; i < node_num; i++) {
    sorted[order[i]] = graph[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  std::vector<Node> graph;
  graph.push_back(Node(0, {3}, {2}));
  graph.push_back(Node(1, {3}, {2}));
  graph.push_back(Node(2, {0, 1}, {}));
  graph.push_back(Node(3, {}, {0, 1}));

  std::vector<Node> sorted(graph.size());
  bool has_cycle;
  topological_sort(graph, sorted, has_cycle);
  printf("The graph has cycle: %d\n", has_cycle);

  printf("The topological order:\n");
  for(int i = 0; i < graph.size(); i++) {
    printf("%d, ", sorted[i].idx);
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```
Some highlights of the code:
* To detect the cycle, we use a three-status array `states` of PENDING,
  PROCESSING, PROCESSED.
* To do the non-recursive, we use a stack `s` that can also keep track of the
  node's "stack status": ENTER, EXIT.
* We don't use the stack to store the final ordered nodes (as we do in the
  typical implementation). Instead, we use an array `order` to simply keep the ordered 
  index of each node.

For each graph used in the post, the above code can correctly sort them and
detect cycles as shown in the table:

Graph | Topological Order | Has Cycle
--- |
Figure 1 left  | 0, 1, 2, 3 | False
Figure 1 middle| 3, 0, 1, 2 | False
Figure 1 right | 3, 0, 1, 2 | False
Figure 2       | 2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5 | False
Figure 3       | 2, 5, 3, 6, 0, 1, 4 | True
